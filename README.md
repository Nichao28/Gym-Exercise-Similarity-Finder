# Project Title

Gym Exercise Similarity Finder (Building AI)

## Summary

The projects gives recommendations on gym exercises based on the similarity to the exercise given by the user. 
Recommendations movement patterns, muscle groups, and equipment used. It can help users discover alternative exercises based on their preferenecs. 


## Background

Choosing suitable alternative exercises can be difficult, especially for beginners or when equipment is limited.
Many fitness apps provide recommendations without explaining why, which can reduce trust and understanding.
My personal motivation comes from an interest in bodybuilding and fitness, where understanding why exercises are similar is just as important as the recommendation itself.

This project addresses:
- lack of explainable exercise recommendations
- difficulty finding substitutes for specific exercises
- limited personalization in workout planning
